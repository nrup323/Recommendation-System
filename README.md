# Recommendation-System
This repository contains various models which can be used for a recommendation engine.

I have tried to build the recommendatios system using 
1) Restricted Boltzman Machines
2) Autoencoders

Models are built using PyTorch.
Dataset used to this test these models can be found [here]("http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k.zip").
